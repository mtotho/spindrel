# Projects

![Project list with shared roots and Blueprint management](../images/project-workspace-list.png)

Projects are named roots inside the shared workspace. Multiple channels can
attach to the same Project so files, terminal cwd, search, harness turns, and
Project instructions resolve from one place while bot-private memory remains
separate through the `memory` tool.

## Project Roots

![Project file browser rooted at the shared Project](../images/project-workspace-detail.png)

Open `/admin/projects` to create or inspect shared roots. A Project owns:

- a workspace-relative root path such as `common/projects/spindrel`;
- optional Project instructions and prompt-file path;
- Project-scoped knowledge under `.spindrel/knowledge-base`;
- channel membership for every channel that should use that root.

The Project detail page is the work surface: use **Files** for the rooted file
browser, **Terminal** for a Project-root shell, **Settings** for instructions
and Blueprint metadata, and **Channels** for membership.

## Blueprints

![Project Blueprint library](../images/project-workspace-blueprints.png)

Project Blueprints are reusable recipes for creating Projects. A Blueprint can
declare a default root pattern, Project prompt, starter folders/files, knowledge
files, repo declarations, env defaults, and required secret binding slots.

Blueprint v0 materializes files and records declarations. It does not clone
repos, run setup commands, or inject secret values into runtimes. Secret values
stay in the secret vault; Projects only store bindings to those vault entries.

## Applied Blueprints

When a Project is created from a Blueprint, the Project stores an applied
snapshot. Editing or deleting the Blueprint later does not rewrite existing
Projects. Use the Project settings Blueprint section to inspect the snapshot,
repo/env declarations, materialization result, and required secret bindings.

## Channels And Memory

Project-bound channels use the Project root for workspace tools and harness
cwd. Bot memory is still owned by the memory system, not the Project root.
